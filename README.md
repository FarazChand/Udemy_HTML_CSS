# Udemy_HTML_CSS

**OCT 7, 2021**
This is a repository to store the projects I'm working on in Udemy. This is the first course I'm taking on HTML and CSS. It's a course by Jonas Schmedtmann.
I already added the first three projects I was working on and will continue to add the rest of them as I continue working on them.

I want to get used to using GitHub as well as work towards becoming a full stack developer. This is my starting point.
