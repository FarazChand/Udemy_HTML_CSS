Extra transitions

-Default mobile nav code
	If you want to add transitions:
	- Add transition property to the default mobile nav code, all ease-in

	If you want the nav to slide in from the right(negative value for left):
	- Add a transform:transalteX property with a value of 100%
	- on the open-nav code, translate back to 0%





Media Queries
*************
- always set the html font-size property to 62.5%, this makes each rem = 10px.
- do 99% of your sizing and spacing in rem
- when decreasing screen size, you can change all the font using the html font-size
  property and decreasing the percentage, this will decrease the size of everything sized
  rem through-out your whole page. Saves a lot of time
